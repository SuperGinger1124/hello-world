# hello-world
My first repository
I am a 25 year old male who is looking to learn everything he can about computing
I have had a passion for technology since adolescence without many means to learn
After getting burnt out in healthcare work I am pursuing IT work
I am open to suggestions on lucrative career opportunities and things I can learn. 
I like Dr. Pepper and my favorite food is a good cheeseburger. 
I also love tacos
