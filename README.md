# hello-world
I am a 25 year old male who is looking to learn everything he can about computing.
I have had a passion for technology since adolescence without many means to learn.
After getting burnt out in healthcare work I am changing career paths.
I am open to suggestions on lucrative career opportunities and things I can learn. 
I like Dr. Pepper and my favorite food is a good cheeseburger. 
I also love tacos and eat at Taco Bell at least once a week.
